I completed my Ph.D. at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University, and Center for Mathematics and Its Applications, The Australian National University, under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaohua Zhu](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/z_20180628175159671361/70486.htm) and Prof. [Xu-Jia Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/Xujia-Wang.html) in 2010.

My research interests lie primarily in **geometric analysis** and **nonlinear PDEs**.

You can find me at Room 324, Zhihua Building , Peking University. <br> 
Feel free to reach out to me via email at <bzhou@pku.edu.cn>. <br>
I'm always open to communication and collaboration!

This is my [CV](http://lwmath.github.io/files/CV_lw.pdf) (May 2025).
