I completed my Ph.D. at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University, and Center for Mathematics and Its Applications, The Australian National University, under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaohua Zhu] (https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/z_20180628175159671361/70486.htm) and Prof.[Xu-Jia Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/Xujia-Wang.html) in 2010.

In September 2025, I will begin my postdoctoral position at Bocconi University in Italy, working under the supervision of Prof. [Antonio De Rosa](https://dec.unibocconi.eu/people/antonio-de-rosa).

My research interests lie primarily in **geometric analysis** and **nonlinear PDEs**, with a particular focus on **Monge-Amp√®re** type equations.

You can find me at Room 203, Building 19, Peking University. <br> 
Feel free to reach out to me via email at <lingwang@stu.pku.edu.cn> & <lwmath@foxmail.com>. <br>
I'm always open to communication and collaboration!

This is my [CV](http://lwmath.github.io/files/CV_lw.pdf) (May 2025).
