I am an associate Professor at Peking University.

I was a Research Fellow at The Australian National University between 2012-2016.

I was a Postdoc at BICMR between 2010-2012.

I completed my Ph.D. at Peking University and the Australian National University, under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaohua Zhu](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/z_20180628175159671361/70486.htm) and Prof. [Xu-Jia Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/Xujia-Wang.html) in 2010.

My research interests lie primarily in **geometric analysis** and **nonlinear PDEs**.

You can find me at Room 324, Zhihua Building , Peking University. <br> 
Feel free to reach out to me via email at <bzhou@pku.edu.cn>. <br>
I'm always open to communication and collaboration!

This is my [CV](http://bzhou1982.github.io/files/CV_bzhou.pdf) (June 2025).
